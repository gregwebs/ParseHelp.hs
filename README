A friendlier interface to the CmdArgs haskell library

When using the CmdArgs library, one specifieds command line arguments in haskell.
Among other things, this automatically generates a --help output.

The goal of this library is to allow you to instead start by writing the --help output,
and then parse that back to a CmdArgs data structure.


Status: The help parser compiles, but isn't tested

TODO:
* test help parser
* convert parsed data structure into CmdArgs data structure
