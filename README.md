A friendlier interface to command line parsing.

You write out the help contents for your command line, and this generates a command line parser for you.

Currently there is only a CmdArgs backend, but it could be made to work with any command line parser.
Normally when using the CmdArgs library, one specifieds command line arguments in Haskell code.
Among other things, this automatically generates a --help output.
So now we are just going about this backwards.

Status: All works, except for a pesky run time crash!
